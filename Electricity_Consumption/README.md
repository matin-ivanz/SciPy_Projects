# Electricity Consumption

## Overview
- In this project, the electricity consumption of a house is monitored for 30 days, and the main goal of this project is to learn the SciPy library.

## Objective
- The goal of this project is to learn various SciPy methods and capabilities and increase your skills working in Python and other libraries.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Working with os, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas libraries
- Use of interpolate, signal, stats, optimize, integrate, fft

## Feature Engineering
Construct features from the power consumption signal in the following order:
- time
- signal
- signal_filled
- signal_clean
- model_prediction

## Visualizations
- Line chart(plot): Examine the differences between the original signal, the filled signal, the filtered signal, and the predicted signal.
- Histogram: To check the complete distribution of the filled signal and the predicted signal error.

## Conclusion
- The signal is randomly generated, contains noise and empty values, and is saved in a file in (csv) format.
- Empty values ​​are filled and noise is eliminated.
- Normality and differences between the first half of the month and the second half of the month are examined.
- The mean, standard deviation, and variance of electricity consumption are printed.
- A model is built to predict electricity consumption and its error is checked.
- Frequencies are analyzed and line graphs and histograms are used to show signal characteristics.
